  summary:
    "A selection of luminous, fiercely intelligent verse from Egypt's premier poet. Iman Mersal is Egypt and indeed the Arab world great outsider poet. Over the past three decades, she has crafted a voice that is ferocious and tender, street-smart and vulnerable. Her early work captures the energies of Cairo's legendary literary boh & Atilde me , peopled by Lovers of hashish and awkward confessions / Anti-state agitators&rdquo; and People like me. These are poems of wit and rage, freaked by moments of sudden beauty, like the scent of guava&rdquo; mysteriously wafting through the City of the Dead. Other poems bear witness to agonizing loss and erotic temptation, the breath of two bodies that never had enough time / and so took pleasure in their mounting terror. Mersal's most recent work addresses itself to the traumas of displacement and migration, as well as the pleasure of crossing boundaries, personal and political, in literature and in life.",

    summary:
      'HARROWINGS takes place mainly in the rural and reconnects with a history of Black intellectual and artistic history in relation to agriculture. The poems include pulses of memoir from the poet&#39;s childhood growing up in the country on a farm. These experiences connect to her volunteer work during the recent pandemic, on a local &#34;prison farm&#34; – an agricultural enterprise whose leadership includes people who were formerly incarcerated. Considering movements organizing for food security, and related, resurgent practices, HARROWINGS addresses the work of cultivation. Underlying references include almanacs and Anglo idioms, drawing upon tabular information, weather, and the workings of the sun, moon, and points of stars as may be practical in relation to a localized, growing year. The poems refuse the romance of husbandry, cultivation, and predictive customs. Understanding &#34;the farm&#34; as a tract of colonial advance – tropes of charming and white, tradition and supremacy, are confronted in a study of biome, water, soil, and seed. With love, despite episodic and chronic illness, duress, and dissociative relationships to time – the poetry advances by way of practical tasks such as watering, weeding, and sowing toward abolitionist futures.',

    summary:
      'Openwork and Limestone is a finely-wrought and potent new poetry collection from one of Canada&rsquo;s most compelling poets. In Frances Boyle&rsquo;s powerful vision, the rituals of contemporary women are seen through the lens of Celtic warrior queens, and goddesses. The natural and created worlds &ndash; as they run, as Boyle says, &ldquo;through the funnel / of my palms&rdquo; &ndash; are a constant source of awe and woman&rsquo;s strength. A reverie that allows in the brutality of history and prehistory, as well as the joys. &ldquo;The unconscious / swimming upward. What won&rsquo;t stay buried rises / through rocks, rough-ridden and rusty.&rdquo; Boyle&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>Openwork and Limestone</em> turns inward and outward at the same time, telling our multifarious collective human story so that it feels like our own intimate family history.',

    summary:
      'The sixth collection of poetry from the award-winning poet; Antony Di Nardo takes the reader on a journey into and through mortality, nostalgia, memories of home, lost love, forgetting, the cycle of loss and unexpected yet welcome discovery, with the resilient daylily as an ever present companion; the collection is told with Di Nardos customary grace, modesty, rhythm and precision; poems to learn from, be moved by, surprised by and encouraged by. COMP. TITLES: Skylight, Antony Di Nardo (2018, Ronsdale Press); It Doesnt Matter What We Meant, Rob Winger (2021, Penguin Random House); As Far as You Know, A.F. Mortiz (2020, House of Anansi) Antony Di Nardo&apos;s poems have a sublime precision that relies on the sonic and visual play of language. In poetry that surprises as much as it illuminates, Di Nardo delves into aspects of mortality, memory and forgetting, the cycles of loss and discovery. Di Nardo&apos;s sixth collection takes its name from the Chinese ideogram for daylily, that tawny orange blossom, which bursts its borders in the summer and, in this book, nds its way into poetry that blurs the line between mysticism and lyricism.',

And poems about Yukon adventures and the wonders and plight of monarch butterflies in Mexican highlands. It&rsquo;s also a diverse gathering of elegies for friends, literary luminaries, creatures and natural habitats in a world under siege, but also a series of hymns to art, beauty, human dignity and endurance.',

    summary:
      'Moving beyond the themes of race, identity, and personhood navigated in&nbsp;<i>Mythical Man</i>, David Ls second book of poetry,&nbsp;<em>Dream of Me as Water</em>, explores ways of being that are not beholden to the expectations of others. Using water as his central metaphor, Ly meditates on how identity is never a stagnant concept, but instead something that is intangible, fluid, and ever-evolving.&nbsp;<em>Dream of Me as Water</em> revels in the nuances of the self, flouting outside perceptions for deeper, more personal realities. .&nbsp;',
